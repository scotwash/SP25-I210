## Field Trip Project

### Project Description

For my field trip artifact, I chose a Native American sculpture of a turtle. I chose this artifact because I found the design of the sculpture to be very unique and appealing. This turtle statue has a very simple design, with the turtle having tan skin with a cream-colored shell. On the shell it has a colorful swirling pattern. The turtle's face also stands out, almost having a human like expression. However the turtle also has smaller versions of itself crawling over it. This is assumedly their children, making this turtle most likely female. And then at the end it has a small tail curling outside of its shell. 

This piece is simply called "Storyteller" and it was believed to be made sometime between 1990 and 2005; it is made of carved clay and paint. The artist is Terry Tabia, who was born in Tesuque Pueblo, Mexico in 1970. 

I believe that preserving pieces like these are very important because many pieces of Native American art have been lost and even information about Native American artists have been lost to time. And I feel like showing information about pieces like this on a website will make things more accessible. 

### Core Webpages and Proposed Features

If I were to make a website showing this artifact off, I would make a website that would make it more interactive to learn about this sculpture and what culture it comes from. The website would consist of three main pages. The main page would an animated gif of the turtle swimming with its children. When the user clicks on the turtle, it would take the user to a new screen where the creature would fall apart into smaller pieces and turn white, and a text box pointing to the arrow would talk about what clay it is made of and it would make a small cooking particle, showing that it is baked clay. Then a small animated paintbrush would appear and would paint the textures on the turtle showing how the patterns were painted on. Then the turtle would swim and you would be able to see the background change to New Mexico where more text boxes would talk about New Mexican culture and then begin talking about the artist. 

### Design Choices

For this website I want to use a simple but colorful color palette, so I used colors that are used in the sculpture and then other colors that complemented it.
